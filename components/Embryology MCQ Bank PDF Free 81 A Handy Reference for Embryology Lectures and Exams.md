Embryology is the study of the development of an organism from a fertilized egg to a fully formed individual. It is a fascinating and complex subject that requires a lot of memorization and understanding of various concepts and processes. One way to test your knowledge and prepare for exams is to practice with multiple choice questions (MCQs) that cover different aspects of embryology.
 
One source of embryology MCQs is Khan Academy, a free online learning platform that offers various courses and resources for students.

Second, some of the MCQs are too easy or too hard, which may not reflect the level of difficulty that you will encounter in your exams. Third, some of the MCQs have errors or ambiguities in their wording or answer choices, which may confuse you or lead you to incorrect answers.
