Once you have imported your data, you can use the software to process and review it using various tools and views. You can perform RTK, Static, FastStatic, and stop-and-go Kinematic data processing. You can also perform data reduction, computation, QA/QC, and network adjustment. You can visualize your data in plan views, 3D views, time-based data views, and session editors. You can also use the software to perform scan inspection workflows, feature extraction workflows, tunneling workflows, and aerial photogrammetry workflows.
 
After you have processed and analyzed your data, you can export it to a design package or another format. You can export data as points or in CAD or XML format. You can also export control data to the field software for use in the field. The software allows you to generate various reports and plots for your data.
