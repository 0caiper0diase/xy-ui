Here are some facts and trivia about Spirited Away that you might not know:

- Spirited Away was inspired by Miyazaki's visit to a friend's house in the countryside, where he met his friend's 10-year-old daughter. He wanted to make a film that would appeal to her and other young girls who were not interested in typical anime.
- Spirited Away features many references to Japanese folklore and mythology, such as the Shinto gods, the river spirits, the radish spirit, the dragon Haku, and the no-face creature. Miyazaki also incorporated elements from his own childhood memories, such as the bathhouse and the train ride.
- Spirited Away was the first film to earn $200 million at the box office before opening in the United States. It also became the first and only hand-drawn and non-English animated film to win an Oscar.
- Spirited Away has influenced many filmmakers and artists around the world, such as Guillermo del Toro, John Lasseter, Pete Docter, and Neil Gaiman. It has also been compared to Alice in Wonderland, The Wizard of Oz, and The Chronicles of Narnia.
- Spirited Away has a hidden environmental message, as Miyazaki wanted to show the effects of human greed and pollution on nature. For example, the river spirit that Chihiro cleans is actually a polluted god who has been corrupted by garbage and sludge.
