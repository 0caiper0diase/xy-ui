Miles Davis was one of the most influential and innovative jazz musicians of the 20th century. He constantly explored new musical directions and styles, from bebop to cool jazz, from modal jazz to fusion. In 1970, he was at the peak of his electric period, leading a band that featured Keith Jarrett on keyboards, John McLaughlin on guitar, Michael Henderson on bass, Jack DeJohnette on drums, and Airto Moreira on percussion.
