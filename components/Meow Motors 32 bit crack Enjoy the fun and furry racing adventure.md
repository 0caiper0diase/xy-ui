## The Tracks
 
Meow Motors offers 20 different tracks where you can race with your kitty friends. The tracks are divided into four themes: city, jungle, desert, and snow. Each theme has its own obstacles, shortcuts, and scenery that you have to watch out for. For example, in the city theme, you have to avoid traffic cones, cars, and trains. In the jungle theme, you have to dodge vines, logs, and animals. In the desert theme, you have to deal with sandstorms, cacti, and pyramids. In the snow theme, you have to slide on ice, avoid snowmen, and jump over gaps.
 
The tracks also have three different modes: circle races, drifts, and 'strike' mode. In circle races, you have to complete a number of laps and finish first.
