After completing the final touches on the restoration project, I carefully put the engine and the radio control gear back into their places. Then I reattached all of the accessories, such as the propeller, the landing gear and the decals, to make the model plane look as good as new. It had been almost 35 years since I first bought this Stinger 120 kit, but I never got around to flying it. Now, with a fresh battery in the RC system and a clear sky above me, I was ready to see it soar. I switched on the transmitter and the receiver, checked the controls and gave it some throttle. The plane took off smoothly and flew gracefully in the air. I felt a surge of joy and pride as I watched my Stinger 120 make its long-awaited maiden flight.
  
I had always loved model planes since I was a kid. I used to spend hours building them from scratch, painting them with realistic colors and details, and testing them in the backyard. I dreamed of becoming a pilot someday, but life had other plans for me. I got married, had kids, and worked as an accountant for a local company. I still kept my hobby, but I had less time and money to devote to it. I bought the Stinger 120 kit in 1988, hoping to build it and fly it someday, but it ended up collecting dust in my garage.

When the pandemic hit in 2020, I suddenly found myself with more free time than ever. I decided to use it productively and finish some of the projects that I had started but never completed. I dug out the Stinger 120 box from the garage and opened it. It was like opening a time capsule. The parts were still in good condition, but they needed some cleaning and polishing. I also had to replace some of the electronics and wires that had become outdated or damaged. I enjoyed working on the plane, feeling nostalgic and excited at the same time.
  
It took me several months to finish the restoration, but it was worth it. The plane looked amazing, just like I had imagined it when I bought it. I wanted to share this achievement with someone who would appreciate it, so I called my son, who was also into model planes. He was happy to hear from me and agreed to come over and see the plane. He brought his own model plane with him, a sleek jet that he had built himself. We decided to go to a nearby park where there was enough space and wind for flying.
  
We arrived at the park and set up our planes. There were a few other people there, some with their own model planes, some with their dogs or kids. We found a spot where we could launch and land our planes safely. I checked the Stinger 120 one last time, making sure everything was working properly. I felt a bit nervous, but also eager to see it fly. I handed the transmitter to my son and asked him to hold it for me. I picked up the plane and ran a few steps before throwing it into the air.
  
The plane climbed steadily and smoothly, responding well to the controls. I took the transmitter from my son and started to maneuver the plane. It was a joy to fly it, feeling the wind and the speed. The plane performed beautifully, doing loops and rolls and dives. I could hear my son cheering me on and giving me tips. He was proud of me and impressed by the plane. I was proud of him too, and grateful for his support.
  
After about 15 minutes of flying, I decided to land the plane. I reduced the throttle and brought the plane closer to the ground. I aligned it with the runway and gently touched down. The plane rolled for a few feet and then stopped. I switched off the transmitter and the receiver and walked over to the plane. It was intact, with no scratches or dents. I picked it up and hugged it. I had done it. I had flown my Stinger 120.
