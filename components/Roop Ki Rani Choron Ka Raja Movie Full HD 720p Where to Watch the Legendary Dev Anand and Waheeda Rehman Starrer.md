# Roop Ki Rani Choron Ka Raja: A Classic Bollywood Action Comedy
 
Roop Ki Rani Choron Ka Raja (The Queen of Beauty and the King of Thieves) is a 1993 Hindi action comedy film starring Anil Kapoor, Sridevi, Jackie Shroff, Anupam Kher and Johnny Lever. It was the highest-budget Indian film at that time, costing â¹9.2 crore (equivalent to â¹54 crore or US$7.5 million in 2019). The film was directed by Satish Kaushik and written by Javed Akhtar.
 
The film revolves around childhood sweethearts, Ramesh (Anil Kapoor) and Seema (Sridevi), who are separated after their fathers are killed by Jugran (Anupam Kher), a crime lord. Ramesh grows up to be a con artist, while Seema becomes a dancer and singer. They reunite after many years and join forces to take revenge on Jugran, who has also stolen a priceless necklace from them. Along the way, they encounter many obstacles and challenges, as well as some hilarious situations.

Roop Ki Rani Choron Ka Raja was a highly anticipated film, as it marked the reunion of Anil Kapoor and Sridevi after their blockbuster hits Mr. India (1987) and Lamhe (1991). The film also featured some memorable songs composed by Laxmikant-Pyarelal, such as "Tu Roop Ki Rani Tu Choron Ka Raja", "Main Hoon Roop Ki Rani", "Dushman Dil Ka Jo Hai Mere" and "Jaane Wale Zara Ruk Ja". The film also showcased some impressive action sequences and stunts, such as the train robbery scene and the climax scene.
 
However, despite its massive budget and star cast, the film flopped miserably at the box office upon its release in 1993. It earned only â¹2.7 crore (equivalent to â¹16 crore or US$2.2 million in 2019), making it one of the biggest disasters in Bollywood history. The film was criticized for its weak script, poor direction, excessive length and outdated style. The film also suffered from production delays, creative differences and legal issues, which hampered its quality and appeal.
 
Over the years, however, the film has gained a cult following among fans of Anil Kapoor and Sridevi, who appreciate its entertainment value and nostalgic charm. The film is also considered as a landmark in Bollywood cinema for its ambitious scale and technical aspects. The film is now available to watch online on ZEE5[^1^], where you can enjoy it in full HD 720p quality.
  
Roop Ki Rani Choron Ka Raja is also notable for being the last film of Sridevi with Anil Kapoor, who was her most frequent co-star and close friend. The duo had worked together in 13 films, including some of the most iconic and successful films of the 1980s and 1990s. Their chemistry and charisma on screen was unmatched and admired by millions of fans. Sridevi passed away in 2018, leaving behind a legacy of excellence and elegance.

The film also marked the debut of Satish Kaushik as a director, who had previously worked as an actor and writer. He took over the project after Shekhar Kapur, who had initially started the film, left it midway due to creative differences with the producer Boney Kapoor, who was also Sridevi's husband. Satish Kaushik faced many challenges and pressures while directing the film, as he had to deal with the high expectations, the huge budget and the star egos. He later apologized for the failure of the film and expressed his regret for not being able to deliver a better product.
 
Roop Ki Rani Choron Ka Raja is a film that has a mixed reputation among Bollywood lovers. Some consider it as a masterpiece that was ahead of its time and misunderstood by the audience. Others consider it as a disaster that wasted the talent and resources of its makers. Whatever your opinion may be, you cannot deny that the film is a part of Bollywood history and deserves to be watched at least once.
