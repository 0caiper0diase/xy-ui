## The Spectre: A Comic Book History of DC's Spirit of Vengeance
 
The Spectre is one of the oldest and most powerful characters in DC Comics. He is a supernatural entity that acts as the embodiment of God's wrath, punishing the wicked with extreme and often ironic methods. He is also a former human who was granted a second chance at life as a ghostly avenger.
 
The Spectre was created by Jerry Siegel and Bernard Baily and first appeared in More Fun Comics #52 released in February 1940[^1^]. In this first incarnation, the Spectre was a New York City cop, Jim Corrigan, who was murdered by gangsters and resurrected by a mysterious voice (later revealed to be God) as a spirit of vengeance. He joined the Justice Society of America, the first superhero team in comics, and fought alongside other heroes like Flash, Green Lantern, and Hawkman.
 
After World War II, the Spectre's popularity declined and he disappeared from comics for two decades. He was revived in the 1960s as part of DC's Silver Age, but his stories were toned down to fit the Comics Code Authority's guidelines. He became more of a superhero than a horror character, and his powers were limited by his human host's conscience. He also had a brief romance with Madame Xanadu, a mystical sorceress.
 
In the 1970s, the Spectre returned to his darker roots under the guidance of writers like Michael Fleisher and Jim Aparo. He became more ruthless and brutal in his methods of justice, often killing his enemies in gruesome and creative ways. He also faced more supernatural threats like demons, vampires, and witches. He also had a rivalry with the Phantom Stranger, another mysterious agent of the divine.

In the 1980s, the Spectre played a crucial role in Crisis on Infinite Earths, the epic crossover that reshaped DC's multiverse. He fought against the Anti-Monitor, the cosmic villain who was destroying parallel worlds, and helped save the remaining Earths from annihilation. He also witnessed the death of his friend Barry Allen, the second Flash.
 
In the 1990s, the Spectre underwent another major change when Jim Corrigan was finally allowed to enter Heaven and leave behind his role as the Spectre. The spirit then bonded with Hal Jordan, the former Green Lantern who had gone insane and become Parallax, a cosmic menace. Jordan sought redemption for his sins and became a more compassionate Spectre, but also struggled with his lack of control over his powers.
 
In the 2000s, the Spectre was separated from Hal Jordan and became an unbound force of vengeance again. He unleashed his wrath on various targets, including magic users, superheroes, and even God himself. He was eventually stopped by a new host, Crispus Allen, a Gotham City detective who was killed by a corrupt cop. Allen became a reluctant Spectre who tried to balance his duty with his morality.
 
In the 2010s, the Spectre appeared in various stories and events, such as Blackest Night, Brightest Day, Flashpoint, and Forever Evil. He also had a brief encounter with Batman during Dark Nights: Metal. He is currently part of Justice League Dark, a team of magic-based heroes led by Wonder Woman.
 
The Spectre has also appeared in other media, such as animated films (DC Showcase: The Spectre), live-action TV shows (Constantine), video games (DC Universe Online), and novels (Kingdom Come). He is one of the most iconic and influential characters in DC Comics history.
