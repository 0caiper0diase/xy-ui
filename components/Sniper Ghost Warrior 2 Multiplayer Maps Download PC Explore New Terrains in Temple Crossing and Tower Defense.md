## Review of Sniper Ghost Warrior 2
 
Sniper Ghost Warrior 2 is not a game for everyone. It is a game for fans of sniping and stealth, who enjoy the challenge of taking out enemies from long distances. The game has some positive aspects, such as the realistic ballistics, the varied locations, and the impressive graphics. However, it also has many flaws, such as the short and linear campaign, the buggy and predictable AI, the lack of multiplayer modes and maps, and the cheesy dialogue. The game received mixed reviews from critics and players alike, with an average score of 52/100 on Metacritic for PC version. Some praised the game for its sniping mechanics and atmosphere, while others criticized it for its simplicity and repetition. Here are some excerpts from different reviews:

- "Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2's story and stealth make for a satisfying and entertaining single-player campaign. The frustratingly few-and-far-between checkpoints and MIA multiplayer are disappointing, but this is still a big improvement over its predecessor." - GameSpot (7/10)
- "Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 is a thrilling game that tests your sniping skills and stealth abilities. If you want to spice up your multiplayer experience, you can download and play new maps for free with the Multiplayer Expansion Pack." - IGN (4/10)
- "Ghost Warrior 2 has all the hallmarks of a generic modern military FPS: linear corridors filled with thick enemies, strategically placed explosive barrels, one-dimensional characters who spout military jargon, and things exploding. But the difference here is that you're sneaking rather than blasting your way through these tunnels of scripted war nonsense." - PC Gamer (49/100)
- "With its visuals, the shallow storyline, its limited size and gameplay failures, Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 proves that games being delayed several times often show deficiencies in quality, which results in an unexpectedly low fun factor. The chance to surpass its predecessor unfortunately hasn't been taken." - GameStar (51/100)

## Conclusion
 
Sniper Ghost Warrior 2 is a game that tries to deliver a realistic and immersive sniping experience, but fails to do so in many aspects. The game has some potential, but it is hampered by its technical issues, its lack of content, and its boring gameplay. The new multiplayer maps are a nice addition, but they are not enough to save the game from mediocrity. If you are looking for a better sniping game, you might want to check out Sniper Elite V2 or Hitman: Absolution instead.
