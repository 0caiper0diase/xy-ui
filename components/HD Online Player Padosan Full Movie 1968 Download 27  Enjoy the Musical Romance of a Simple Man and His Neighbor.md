Padosan (1968) is not only a comedy film, but also a musical one. The film features some of the most popular songs of Indian cinema, composed by R. D. Burman and sung by Kishore Kumar, Manna Dey, Lata Mangeshkar and Asha Bhosle. Some of the songs are \"Mere Samne Wali Khidki Mein\", \"Ek Chatur Naar\", \"Bhai Batur\", \"Kehna Hai\" and \"Main Chali Main Chali\". The songs are not only catchy and humorous, but also integral to the plot and the characters. The song \"Ek Chatur Naar\" is especially famous for its comic duel between Kishore Kumar and Mehmood.
 
Padosan (1968) is also a remake of a Bengali film Pasher Bari (1952), which was based on a short story of the same name by Arun Chowdhury. The film was remade in several other Indian languages, such as Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Kannada. The film was also remade in Hindi as Nayee Padosan (2003), with a different cast and plot. The original film, however, remains the most loved and admired version among the audiences and critics alike.
 
Padosan (1968) is also known for its trivia and behind-the-scenes stories. For instance, Kishore Kumar choreographed the song \"Meri Bindu\" himself and instructed the cast to follow his silly actions. Sunil Dutt and Mehmood were afraid of being overshadowed by Kishore Kumar's performance and cut down some of his scenes. Mehmood had to persuade Kishore Kumar to act in the film as he was not interested in acting at that time. The film was produced by Mehmood's own production house and was his first ambitious motion picture.
